This is a simple program to convert the RGB imageThis is a simple program to convert the RGB image to a grayscale image using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is an intermediate program for those who are learning web development.

There is a simple logic behind this using color theory. A grayscale image is an average of the RGB color of a pixel. for e.g. Grayscale of green i.e. (0,255,0) is (0+255+0)/3=85 set all pixel to this average using for loop to a grayscale image using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
